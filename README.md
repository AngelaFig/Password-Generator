# <Random-Password-Generator>

## Description
In this project, I received starter code which I  modified in order to create a functional random password generator that runs in the browser and creates a password based on criteria that the user selects.  The user is presented with a prompt to enter a desired  character length between 8 and 128 characters followed by a series of prompts asking the user to confirm whether or not they would like their password  to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters and numbers.  Once complete, the random password is then displayed on the screen. 

One may notice that my JavaScript has a few comments that have been left in the code. This challenge certainly taught me the importance of pseudo-coding.  


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
